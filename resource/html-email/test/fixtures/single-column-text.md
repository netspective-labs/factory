Hi User,

This week at HealthIMPACT Spring 2022 we’ll be asking our healthcare delivery organization (HDO) innovators about whether they think HDO innovation is something real, with definable expectations, or if the term “innovation” is just hype without measurable objectives. Many of our colleagues believe we might be in an innovation bubble that’s not predictable in terms of outcomes.

We’ll also be talking about whether HDO innovation is a proper discipline practiced by professionals or if it’s not really a profession at all. We’ll be discussing what key tenets should an innovation professional be accountable for – for example, who’s responsible for innovations when they succeed or fail?

## Help us define an innovation lifecycle

No serious endeavors, especially something as important as the definition and procurement of innovation in healthcare delivery organizations should be undertaken without a disciplined lifecycle with well-known outcomes and expectations. 

* Project management has a lifecycle, software development has a lifecycle, digital transformation has a lifecycle, why not HDO innovation?
* We’ll be asking audience members to share what, if any, evidence driven, repeatable innovation steps they follow at the best organizations. 
* We will use those learnings to extract what common lifecycle steps should be taught to innovation professionals to create a disciplined innovation lifecyle that practitioners can successfully replicate.

As a health practitioner yourself, your opinion on this topic matters. In fact, it is critical. I invite you to join the discussion, share your thoughts and join us to find some actionable insights.
