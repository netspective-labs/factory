# List 2

A place to capture topics that should be discussed with a larger team.

- [ ] GPM usage frictions are such that by the time i got to this page to capture a topic, I've already forgotten what it was.
- [X] Do we have milestone for continuous work (bugs, tweaks, etc...) 
- [ ] Milestones are inherently timed, but there are classes of work for which there is not end -- like process improvement.  Conflating coherent sets of work with clear definitions of done and time boxes with coherent sets of continuous effort creates a lot of noise or it means that only one set can use milestones, leaving the other with no higher order organization (aside from labels)
