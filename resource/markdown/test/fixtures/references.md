# References in Markdown

See [Links and References](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link) for discussion.
Linking is very important so we want to know how to use all the styles.

This is my [random value] located somewhere in my Markdown document.

[random value]: variable value

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.somewebsite.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.somewebsite.com "somewebsite's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.somewebsite.org
[1]: http://somewebsite.org
[link text itself]: http://www.somewebsite.com

This is a *reference* to [Google][], [Yahoo][], and [MSN][]. Note the hover titles, too.

[google]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
